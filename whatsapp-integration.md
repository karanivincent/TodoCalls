# WhatsApp Business API Integration - TeliTask

## Overview
Transform TeliTask into a comprehensive task management platform accessible entirely through WhatsApp. Users interact with an intelligent AI agent via WhatsApp messages to manage their tasks, schedules, and reminders without ever needing to open the web application.

## Core Features

### 1. Conversational Task Management

Users interact with tasks through natural conversation, making task management as simple as chatting with a friend.

#### Natural Language Task Creation
```
User: "Hey, I need to call my dentist tomorrow at 3pm"
AI: "✅ I've scheduled a reminder call for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Should I call you or someone else?"
User: "Call me"
AI: "Perfect! You'll receive a call tomorrow at 3:00 PM about 'Call dentist'. Want me to add any notes?"
```

#### Task Updates via Chat
```
User: "Move my dentist appointment to Friday"
AI: "I've rescheduled 'Call dentist' from tomorrow 3:00 PM to Friday 3:00 PM. Is this correct?"
User: "Yes"
AI: "✅ Updated! You'll now receive the reminder on Friday at 3:00 PM."
```

#### Task Completion
```
User: "Done with grocery shopping"
AI: "Great job! ✅ I've marked 'Grocery shopping' as complete. You have 2 more tasks today."
```

### 2. Smart Context Understanding

The AI maintains conversation context across multiple messages, enabling complex multi-turn interactions.

#### Multi-Step Task Creation
```
User: "Add three tasks"
AI: "Sure! What's the first task?"
User: "Buy groceries"
AI: "When should I remind you?"
User: "6pm today"
AI: "Got it! What's the second task?"
User: "Call mom"
AI: "When for this one?"
User: "Tomorrow morning"
AI: "Added! And the third task?"
User: "Submit report"
AI: "When's the deadline?"
User: "Friday noon"
AI: "Perfect! I've added all 3 tasks:
✅ Buy groceries - Today 6:00 PM
✅ Call mom - Tomorrow morning
✅ Submit report - Friday 12:00 PM"
```

#### Context-Aware Responses
```
User: "What time was that meeting again?"
AI: "Based on our conversation, you have 'Team meeting' scheduled for 2:00 PM today."
User: "Add John to it"
AI: "I'll update the task to include 'with John'. Should I also send John a reminder?"
```

### 3. Voice Note Processing

Users can send WhatsApp voice notes that are automatically transcribed and processed into tasks.

#### Voice Note Features
- **Automatic Transcription**: Convert voice messages to text
- **Intent Recognition**: Understand task-related requests from audio
- **Confirmation**: Always confirm interpretation before creating tasks
- **Multi-language Support**: Process voice notes in multiple languages

#### Example Flow
```
🎤 User sends voice note: "Remind me to pick up the kids from school at 3:30"
AI: "I heard: 'Pick up kids from school at 3:30 PM'
📅 Should I set this for today or another day?"
User: "Today"
